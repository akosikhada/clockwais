## 📋 Overview

ClockWais is a gamified productivity application designed to enhance employee engagement and motivation without disrupting existing workflows. By layering interactive elements, progress feedback, and rewards on top of standard project management tools, ClockWais transforms mundane work routines into meaningful and enjoyable experiences.

According to Gallup's 2024 State of the Global Workplace report, only 23% of employees worldwide are actively engaged in their work. ClockWais addresses this challenge through a thoughtfully designed system of external motivators, structured time management, and gamification elements.
